## 🎮 How to Play

### Game Objective
**Get the lowest total card value in your hand** - then declare "CABO" to end the game!

### Setup
- Each player starts with 4 cards
- First 2 cards are revealed briefly at game start
- Remaining cards stay face-down (test your memory!)

### Your Turn Actions

#### 1. **Draw from Deck**
- Click "Draw from Deck" to draw a card
- Decide whether to keep or discard it

#### 2. **Swap a Card**
- After drawing, click "Swap a Card"
- Click any card in your hand to replace it
- The old card goes to the discard pile

#### 3. **Use Action Cards**
- If you draw an action card (ranks 7-12), use its special ability:
  - **Peek (7-8)**: Look at one of your own cards
  - **Spy (9-10)**: Look at another player's card
  - **Switch (11-12)**: Exchange cards with another player

#### 4. **Declare CABO**
- Click "Declare CABO" when you think you have the lowest score
- **Warning**: Everyone gets one more turn after you declare!

#### 5. **End Turn**
- Click "End Turn" to pass to the next player

### Card Values
- **Ace**: 1 point
- **2-10**: Face value
- **Jack**: 11 points
- **Queen**: 12 points
- **King**: 13 points
- **King of Diamonds**: -1 point (special!)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Classes

#### 1. **CaboGame.java** - Main Game Engine
```java
public class CaboGame extends PApplet {
    private Player[] players;           // All 4 players
    private Deck deck;                  // Draw pile
    private Deck discard;               // Discard pile
    private BaseCard drawnCard;         // Currently drawn card
    private int currentPlayer;          // Active player index
    private boolean gameOver;           // Game state
    private ActionState actionState;    // Current action being performed
}
```

#### 2. **Player.java** - Basic Player
```java
public class Player {
    private Hand hand;                  // Player's 4 cards
    private String name;                // Player name
    private int label;                  // Player index (0-3)
    private boolean isComputer;         // AI vs Human
}
```

#### 3. **AIPlayer.java** - Intelligent Computer Player
```java
public class AIPlayer extends Player {
    private boolean[][] cardKnowledge;  // Tracks known cards
    
    public int calcHandBlind();         // Estimates hand value
    public int getUnknownCardIndex();   // Finds unknown cards
    public int getSpyIndex();           // Targets for spying
    public int getHighestIndex();       // Finds worst cards
}
```

#### 4. **BaseCard.java** - Card Representation
```java
public class BaseCard {
    protected int rank;                 // Card rank (1-13)
    protected String suit;              // Card suit
    protected boolean faceUp;           // Visibility state
    
    public void draw(int x, int y);     // Renders card
    public boolean isMouseOver();       // Mouse interaction
    public int getRank();               // Gets card value
}
```

#### 5. **ActionCard.java** - Special Action Cards
```java
public class ActionCard extends BaseCard {
    private String actionType;          // "peek", "spy", "switch"
    
    public String getActionType();      // Returns action type
}
```

### Game Flow Architecture

```
Game Start → Deal Cards → Player Turn → Action Selection → Card Operations → Next Player
     ↑                                                                              ↓
Game Over ← Check CABO Declaration ← End Turn ← Process Action ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
```

## 🤖 AI System

### Card Knowledge Tracking
```java
private boolean[][] cardKnowledge; // [player][cardIndex] = known?
```

### AI Decision Making

#### 1. **Drawing Strategy**
```java
// AI draws card and evaluates
int drawnValue = drawnCard.getRank();
int highestInHand = getHighestIndex();

if (drawnValue < highestInHand) {
    // Swap with worst card
} else if (drawnCard instanceof ActionCard) {
    // Use action ability
} else {
    // Discard drawn card
}
```

#### 2. **Action Card Usage**
- **Peek**: Look at unknown cards in own hand
- **Spy**: Target human player's unknown cards
- **Switch**: Exchange highest card with opponent's lowest known card

#### 3. **CABO Declaration**
```java
int handValue = calcHandBlind();
if (handValue <= random(13, 21)) {
    declareCabo();
}
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### GUI Layout
- **Player Hands**: Displayed in corners (bottom = human player)
- **Center Area**: Deck and discard pile
- **Action Buttons**: Bottom row for human player
- **Game Log**: Right side scrolling message area
- **Drawn Card**: Center display when card is drawn

### Card Rendering
```java
public void draw(int x, int y) {
    if (faceUp) {
        // Show card face with rank/suit
        processing.image(cardImage, x, y, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    } else {
        // Show card back
        processing.image(cardBack, x, y, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    }
}
```

### Button System
```java
public class Button {
    private boolean active;     // Can be clicked
    private String label;       // Button text
    private int x, y;          // Position
    private int width, height; // Dimensions
    
    public void draw();        // Render button
    public boolean isMouseOver(); // Mouse detection
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Game Settings

#### Player Configuration
```java
// In setup() method
players[0] = new Player("Cyntra", 0, false);        // Human player
players[1] = new AIPlayer("Avalon", 1, true);       // AI opponent 1
players[2] = new AIPlayer("Balthor", 2, true);      // AI opponent 2
players[3] = new AIPlayer("Ophira", 3, true);       // AI opponent 3
```

#### Deck Composition
```java
// Cards 1-6: Regular number cards
// Cards 7-8: Peek action cards
// Cards 9-10: Spy action cards
// Cards 11-12: Switch action cards
// Card 13: King (King of Diamonds = -1)
```

### Customization Options

#### Change AI Difficulty
```java
// In AIPlayer.calcHandBlind()
if (!cardKnowledge[getLabel()][i]) {
    total += 6; // Lower estimate = more aggressive AI
}
```

#### Modify CABO Threshold
```java
// In performAITurn()
if (handValue <= random(10, 18)) { // Tighter range = more cautious
    declareCabo();
}
```

#### Add More Players
```java
// Expand arrays and add initialization
private static final int NUM_PLAYERS = 6;
players = new Player[NUM_PLAYERS];
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Features

#### Custom Action Cards
```java
public class CustomActionCard extends ActionCard {
    public CustomActionCard(int rank, String suit) {
        super(rank, suit, "custom");
    }
    
    // Implement custom action logic
}
```

#### Game Variations
```java
// Add to CaboGame class
private boolean quickGame = false;     // Shorter game variant
private boolean teamMode = false;      // Team-based play
private int maxRounds = 5;            // Multi-round tournament
```

#### Enhanced AI
```java
public class ExpertAIPlayer extends AIPlayer {
    private int[] opponentPatterns;    // Track opponent behaviors
    private double riskTolerance;      // Personality trait
    
    @Override
    public int calcHandBlind() {
        // More sophisticated estimation
        return advancedHandCalculation();
    }
}
```

### Testing Framework
```java
public class GameTester {
    public static void testDeckCreation() {
        ArrayList<BaseCard> deck = Deck.createDeck();
        assert deck.size() == 52;
        // Verify card distribution
    }
    
    public static void testAILogic() {
        AIPlayer ai = new AIPlayer("Test", 0, true);
        // Test decision making
    }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images Not Loading**
   ```bash
   # Ensure images folder structure:
   images/
   ├── back.png
   ├── 1_of_clubs.png
   ├── 2_of_clubs.png
   └── ... (all 52 card images)
   ```

2. **Processing Library Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Processing core jar in classpath
   java -cp .:processing-core.jar CaboGame
   ```

3. **Button Not Responding**
   ```java
   // Check button state updates
   updateButtonStates();
   ```

### Debug Features

#### Console Output
```java
// Enable debug mode in CaboGame
private static final boolean DEBUG = true;

if (DEBUG) {
    System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer + " drew: " + drawnCard);
    System.out.println("AI hand value: " + ((AIPlayer)players[i]).calcHandBlind());
}
```

#### Visual Debug Info
```java
// Add to draw() method
if (DEBUG) {
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    text("Current Player: " + currentPlayer, 10, 30);
    text("Action State: " + actionState, 10, 50);
}
```
